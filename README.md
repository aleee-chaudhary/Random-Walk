# Random Walk in Maze [C programming language]
A program that generates a “random walk” across 10x10 array. The array will contain characters (all '.' initially). The program will randomly “walk” from element to element, always going up, down, left, right by one element. The elements visited by the program will be labelled with letters A through Z, in the order visited. The possible moves are up, down, left and right. If all possible directions are blocked, the program will terminate.
